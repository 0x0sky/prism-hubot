module PrismHubot
  # Reads a deployment environment file the way systemd reads
  # `EnvironmentFile=`, which is how the running service is configured
  # (`deploy/prism-hubot.service`).
  #
  # Deployment tasks used to read the same file with `bash`, but `source` is
  # not a parser: it executes what it reads. `TOKEN=<from-botfather>` is a
  # redirection, `SECRET=a|b` is a pipeline, `URL=$(cat /etc/shadow)` is a
  # command substitution. A file the service starts from perfectly well can
  # therefore abort a deployment with `syntax error near unexpected token`.
  # Reading it here keeps one reading of the file and never executes it.
  #
  # Supported syntax, as documented for `EnvironmentFile=`:
  #
  # - `NAME=value`, one assignment per line;
  # - blank lines, and comments introduced by `#` or `;` in the first
  #   non-blank column;
  # - single- and double-quoted values, which may span lines and may hold
  #   whitespace, `#` and shell metacharacters verbatim;
  # - `\` escapes the next character, and `\` at end of line continues the
  #   assignment (or the comment) on the following line;
  # - trailing whitespace of an unquoted value is dropped.
  #
  # There is no variable expansion, no command substitution and no `export`
  # keyword, because systemd has none of them. Lines that are not valid
  # assignments are reported to `on_warning` and skipped rather than raised
  # on: systemd ignores them too, and a reader that rejected a file the
  # service happily starts from would just move the disagreement elsewhere.
